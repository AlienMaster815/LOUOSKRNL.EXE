# Additional Notes

1. **Kernel Licensing**:  Any modifications to the Lousine kernel must be distributed under GPLv2. External modules that are not compiled into the kernel's binary can maintain their own license. However, if a module is statically linked or directly compiled into the kernel, it must be licensed under GPLv2 or a GPL-compatible license. Modules interacting solely through the kernel runtime linker or through user-space interfaces (e.g., Windows System Files) are not required to follow this licensing.
  
2. **User-Space Licensing**: User-space applications or libraries running on Lousine Kernel are not subject to the GPL and can be licensed under any terms.

3. **Proprietary Software**: Proprietary software may run on Lousine without requiring a license change, as long as it does not include or link to GPL-covered kernel code.
