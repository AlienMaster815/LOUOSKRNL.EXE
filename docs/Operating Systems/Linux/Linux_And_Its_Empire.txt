Linux is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the core component of a Linux operating system (OS). Developed by Linus
Torvalds in 1991, Linux has since become one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The Linux kernel is released
under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allows users to view, modify, and distribute the source code.

The term "Linux" is often used more broadly to refer to entire operating systems based on the Linux kernel. These complete operating systems, known as
Linux distributions or distros, include the Linux kernel along with a variety of system software and libraries from the GNU Project, utilities, and
additional software applications. Some well-known Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, and Arch Linux, among many others.

Key characteristics and features of Linux include:

Open Source: Linux is distributed under open-source licenses, allowing users to access and modify the source code freely.

Multitasking and Multiuser: Linux supports multitasking, enabling multiple processes to run simultaneously. It also supports multiple users accessing the
system concurrently.

Stability and Reliability: Linux is known for its stability and reliability. Many servers and critical systems use Linux due to its robust performance.

Security: Linux has a robust security model. Users have restricted access, and permissions are carefully managed to enhance system security.

Networking Capabilities: Linux has excellent networking capabilities, making it a preferred choice for servers and networking devices.

Compatibility: Linux can run on a wide range of hardware platforms, from small embedded systems to large servers.

Package Management: Most Linux distributions use package management systems, making it easy to install, update, and remove software packages.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Linux provides a powerful command-line interface, giving users and administrators extensive control over the system.

Community Support: The Linux community is large and active, providing support, documentation, and development resources.

Linux has gained popularity not only in server environments but also as an operating system for personal computers, embedded systems, mobile devices
(Android is based on the Linux kernel), and even supercomputers. Its flexibility, performance, and the collaborative nature of open-source development
contribute to its widespread use and ongoing evolution.
