	This will be a brief document because even though I'm going through some history in reality
    this thing docent do much, because the cpuid instruction is actually only used for one thing
    and this is getting information from the central processing units main data table such as
    its signature manufacturer and you guessed it its Identification. Why would we need this the
    reason has to do with "The Rise Of The Digital Age". When pentium was at its peak amd the
    owner of intel had a falling out kind of like the Americans and the uk in the American war
    of independence. Intel decided to do its own shit and so did amd with meant that now there
    were two micro controller companies on the market and these two companies had more than one
    processors at this point some in different architecture bitrates special features and register
    so much shit to keep track of so they did the only right decision they ever made was make a
    standardized way for an operating system to tell what the fuck it was running on however
    achitectecture is still a bitch and you have do jump through hoops to fucking party you code
    for each devices which is why until now even Microsoft hasn't fucked arround with  arm but
    anyways lets get back on track enough rambling about bullshit I can't control these cpuid
    systems make it easy for the kernel to use these spectrum of things that should just not
    have existed without being standardized...
