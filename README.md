# LOUOSKRNL.EXE

Known Bugs List:

LICENSE IS IN THE LICENSE FILE

NOTE: Only Releases Folder Will Contain Working kernel/OS images
If your architecture is not available or behind other architectures
I am only one person doing a monumentous task between 3 different 
kernels and I will be adding arm After i finish x86_64

NOTE: Driver systems along with everything else will be cleaned up after
official release

ATTENTION: Microsoft has been adding my software to its malware databases 
in attempt to stop us from developing if windows defender says its a virus 
the binaries are not designed to run on windows they will just give an error
for the kernel it will say "this binary cannot run in UserMode" or "This 
Binary Is Not A Valid Win 32 Application" and any system files are not able
to execute on windows 1 because the LouDDK model is not designed for windows
only to add compatibility to windows drivers and adding new functions for
easier development or 2 because unsigned drivers are not allowed to run on 
windows since an update in the early window 10 era if you get a notification
set windows defender to create an exception from it i have already emailed
microsft they wont do anything. If you are still concerned about the binaries
email me directly at (tgrenier.815@aol.com) for me to explain the issue further
and to explain why the binaries are being blocked based on the emails i have from
microsoft : Sorry For The Inconvienence
